  <li>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
  <li>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li>
  <li>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li>
  <li>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</li>
  <li>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
  <li>If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace &amp; 10), you got a blackjack.</li>
  <li>Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.</li>
  <li>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</li>
  <li>Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only getone more card.</li>
  <li>Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.</li>
  <li>Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.</li>
  <li>You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.</li>
  <li>You cannot play on two aces after they are split.</li>
  <li>You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadruplingyou bet.</li>
